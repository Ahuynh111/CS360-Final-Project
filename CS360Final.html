    <p> 
      This site intends to visualize different metrics on feed grains in the United States. The data spans across roughly 30 years given by the USDA. While the dataset offers data for a handful of different feed grains, this project will only focus on corn, barley, sorghum, and oats. This project does not intend to completely educate on the United State's feed grain economy, but rather give a very general statistical overview through data visualization. We intend to answer the following:
      <br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br>
      1. What are the most common imported/exported grains? And how do they differ across 3 decades?
      <br>
      2. What is the correlation between US prices and imports/exports of another country if any?
      <br>
      3. How does growth look like overtime for each grain import in the US?
      <br>
      4.What specific historical moments can be linked to changes/obscurities in US feed grain data?
    </p>
