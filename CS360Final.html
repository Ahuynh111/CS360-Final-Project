      This site intends to visualize different metrics on feed grains in the United States. The data spans across roughly 30 years given by the United States Department of Agriculture. While the dataset offers data for a handful of different feed grains, this project will only focus on corn, barley, sorghum, and oats. This project does not intend to completely educate on the United State's feed grain economy, but rather give a very general statistical overview through data visualization. We intend to answer the following:
    </p>
    <p><center>
      1. What are the most common imported/exported grains? And how do they differ across 3 decades?
      <br>
      2. How do US imports and exports vary over time?
      <br>
      3. How does growth look like overtime for each grain import in the US?
      <br>
      4. What specific historical moments can be linked to changes/obscurities in US feed grain data?
    </p>
  <h3> <center>About the Data </h3>
  <p><center>
    The data collection is credited to the Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) who provided the vast database on their website <a href ="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables/#Zipped%20CSV%20files"> USDA Feed Grains: Yearbook Tables </a>. Due to lack of time and project needs, the data used on this site is condensed from the original database. The original 35 tables have been filtered down into the 12 most relevent. The tables kept include:
  </p>
  <p><center>
    Table 1: Farming Information
    <br>
    Tables 4-7: Supply and Disappearance (One table per Grain)
    <br>
    Tables 9-10: Farmer Prices (Corn and Sorghum split from Barley and Oats)
    <br>
    Tables 18-19: US Exports (Corn and Sorghum split from Barley and Oats)
    <br>
    Tables 20-21: US Imports (Corn and Sorghum split from Barley and Oats)
    <br>
    Table 27: World Imports and Exports (Select Countries and Select Grains)
