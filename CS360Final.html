  <p> This site intends to visualize different metrics on feed grains in the United States. The data spans across roughly 30 years given by the USDA. While the dataset offers data for a handful of different feed grains, this project will only focus on corn, barley, sorghum, and oats. This project does not intend to completely educate on the United State's feed grain economy, but rather give a very general statistical overview through data visualization. 
    <br> <em> This is a final project for CS360 Data Visualization at the University of San Francisco for the Spring 2024 school term.</em>
